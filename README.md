# ArcClone

A browser built for macOS that organizes your web life into spaces.

## Key Concepts

- **Spaces**: Separate workspaces for different contexts (e.g., Work, Personal). Each space has its own pinned tabs and today tabs.
- **Pinned Tabs**: Your favorite apps and sites that stay put.
- **Today Tabs**: Temporary tabs for your current browsing session. They are archived after 12 hours.
- **Profiles**: Keep your cookies and history separate between spaces.

## Features

- **Command Palette (Cmd+L)**: Quickly open URLs, search the web, or switch to open tabs.
- **Library (Cmd+Shift+L)**: Access your archived tabs, manage spaces, and view downloads.
- **Ad Blocking**: Built-in protection for a cleaner browsing experience.
- **Split View**: The sidebar keeps your spaces and tabs organized, while the main view shows your content.

## How It Works

ArcClone uses the native WebKit engine for fast and secure browsing. Your data is stored locally on your device.
